 *
 * Counting semaphore IPC mechanism
 *
 * A counting semaphore is a synchronization object for controlling
 * the concurrency level allowed in accessing a resource from multiple
 * real-time tasks, based on the value of a count variable accessed
 * atomically.  The semaphore is used through the P ("Proberen", from
 * the Dutch "test and decrement") and V ("Verhogen", increment)
 * operations. The P operation decrements the semaphore count by one
 * if non-zero, or waits until a V operation is issued by another
 * task. Conversely, the V operation releases a resource by
 * incrementing the count by one, unblocking the heading task waiting
 * on the P operation if any. Waiting on a semaphore may cause
 * a priority inversion.
 *
 * If no more than a single resource is made available at any point in
 * time, the semaphore enforces mutual exclusion and thus can be used
 * to serialize access to a critical section. However, mutexes should
 * be used instead in order to prevent priority inversions, based on
 * the priority inheritance protocol.

 * each time it is called, without incrementing the semaphore count,
 * even if no waiter is pending. For this reason, the semaphore count
 * in pulse mode remains zero.
