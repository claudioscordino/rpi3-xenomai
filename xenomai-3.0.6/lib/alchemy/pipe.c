 * Two-way communication channel between Xenomai & Linux domains
 *
 * A message pipe is a two-way communication channel between Xenomai
 * threads and normal Linux threads using regular file I/O operations
 * on a pseudo-device. Pipes can be operated in a message-oriented
 * fashion so that message boundaries are preserved, and also in
 * byte-oriented streaming mode from real-time to normal Linux
 * threads for optimal throughput.
 *
 * Xenomai threads open their side of the pipe using the
 * rt_pipe_create() service; regular Linux threads do the same by
 * opening one of the /dev/rtpN special devices, where N is the minor
 * number agreed upon between both ends of each pipe.
 *
 * In addition, named pipes are available through the registry
 * support, which automatically creates a symbolic link from entries
 * under /proc/xenomai/registry/rtipc/xddp/ to the corresponding
 * special device file.
 *
 * @note Alchemy's message pipes are fully based on the @ref
 * RTIPC_PROTO "XDDP protocol" available from the RTDM/ipc driver.

/**
 * @fn int rt_pipe_create(RT_PIPE *pipe, const char *name, int minor, size_t poolsize)
 * @brief Create a message pipe.
 *
 * This service opens a bi-directional communication channel for
 * exchanging messages between Xenomai threads and regular Linux
 * threads. Pipes natively preserve message boundaries, but can also
 * be used in byte-oriented streaming mode from Xenomai to Linux.
 *
 * rt_pipe_create() always returns immediately, even if no thread has
 * opened the associated special device file yet. On the contrary, the
 * non real-time side could block upon attempt to open the special
 * device file until rt_pipe_create() is issued on the same pipe from
 * a Xenomai thread, unless O_NONBLOCK was given to the open(2) system
 * call.
 *
 * @param pipe The address of a pipe descriptor which can be later used
 * to identify uniquely the created object, upon success of this call.
 *
 * @param name An ASCII string standing for the symbolic name of the
 * pipe. When non-NULL and non-empty, a copy of this string is used
 * for indexing the created pipe into the object registry.
 *
 * Named pipes are supported through the use of the registry. Passing
 * a valid @a name parameter when creating a message pipe causes a
 * symbolic link to be created from
 * /proc/xenomai/registry/rtipc/xddp/@a name to the associated special
 * device (i.e. /dev/rtp*), so that the specific @a minor information
 * does not need to be known from those processes for opening the
 * proper device file. In such a case, both sides of the pipe only
 * need to agree upon a symbolic name to refer to the same data path,
 * which is especially useful whenever the @a minor number is picked
 * up dynamically using an adaptive algorithm, such as passing
 * P_MINOR_AUTO as @a minor value.
 *
 * @param minor The minor number of the device associated with the
 * pipe.  Passing P_MINOR_AUTO causes the minor number to be
 * auto-allocated. In such a case, a symbolic link will be
 * automatically created from
 * /proc/xenomai/registry/rtipc/xddp/@a name to the allocated pipe
 * device entry. Valid minor numbers range from 0 to
 * CONFIG_XENO_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV-1.
 *
 * @param poolsize Specifies the size of a dedicated buffer pool for the
 * pipe. Passing 0 means that all message allocations for this pipe are
 * performed on the Cobalt core heap.
 *
 * @return The @a minor number assigned to the connection is returned
 * upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -ENOMEM is returned if the system fails to get memory from the
 * main heap in order to create the pipe.
 *
 * - -ENODEV is returned if @a minor is different from P_MINOR_AUTO
 * and is not a valid minor number.
 *
 * - -EEXIST is returned if the @a name is conflicting with an already
 * registered pipe.
 *
 * - -EBUSY is returned if @a minor is already open.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service was called from an invalid
 * context, e.g. interrupt or non-Xenomai thread.
