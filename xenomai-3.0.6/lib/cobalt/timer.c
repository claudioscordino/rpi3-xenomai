/**
 * @fn int timer_create(clockid_t clockid, const struct sigevent *__restrict__ evp, timer_t * __restrict__ timerid)
 * @brief Create a timer
 *
 * This service creates a timer based on the clock @a clockid.
 *
 * If @a evp is not @a NULL, it describes the notification mechanism
 * used on timer expiration. Only thread-directed notification is
 * supported (evp->sigev_notify set to @a SIGEV_THREAD_ID).
 *
 * If @a evp is NULL, the current Cobalt thread will receive the
 * notifications with signal SIGALRM.
 *
 * The recipient thread is delivered notifications when it calls any
 * of the sigwait(), sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo() services.
 *
 * If this service succeeds, an identifier for the created timer is
 * returned at the address @a timerid. The timer is unarmed until
 * started with the timer_settime() service.
 *
 * @param clockid clock used as a timing base;
 *
 * @param evp description of the asynchronous notification to occur
 * when the timer expires;
 *
 * @param timerid address where the identifier of the created timer
 * will be stored on success.
 *
 * @retval 0 on success;
 * @retval -1 with @a errno set if:
 * - EINVAL, the clock @a clockid is invalid;
 * - EINVAL, the member @a sigev_notify of the @b sigevent structure at the
 *   address @a evp is not SIGEV_THREAD_ID;
 * - EINVAL, the  member @a sigev_signo of the @b sigevent structure is an
 *   invalid signal number;
 * - EAGAIN, the maximum number of timers was exceeded, recompile with a larger
 *   value.
