Installing Xenomai 3.x
======================

Introduction
------------

Xenomai 3 is the new architecture of the Xenomai real-time framework,
which can run seamlessly side-by-side Linux as a co-kernel system, or
natively over mainline Linux kernels.  In the latter case, the
mainline kernel can be supplemented by the
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/[PREEMPT-RT patch]
to meet stricter response time requirements than standard kernel
preemption would bring.

One of the two available real-time cores is selected at build
time. The dual kernel core is codenamed _Cobalt_, the native Linux
implementation is called _Mercury_.

[NOTE]
If you are looking for detailed information about installing a legacy
Xenomai 2.x release, please refer to link:installing-xenomai-2.x[this
document] instead. Please note that Xenomai 2.x is discontinued and
not maintained anymore.

Installation steps
------------------

Xenomai follows a split source model, decoupling the kernel space
support from the user-space libraries.

To this end, kernel and user-space Xenomai components are respectively
available under the `kernel/` and `lib/` sub-trees. Other top-level
directories, such as `scripts/`, `testsuite/` and `utils/`, provide
additional scripts and programs to be used on either the build host,
or the runtime target.

The `kernel/` sub-tree which implements the in-kernel support code is
seen as a built-in extension of the Linux kernel.  Therefore, the
standard Linux kernel configuration process should be used to define
the various settings for the Xenomai kernel components. All of the
kernel code Xenomai currently introduces implements the _Cobalt_ core
(i.e. dual kernel configuration). As of today, the _Mercury_ core
needs no Xenomai-specific code in kernel space.

The `lib/` sub-tree contains the various user-space libraries exported
by the Xenomai framework to the applications. This tree is built
separately from the kernel support. Libraries are built in order to
support the selected core, either _Cobalt_ or _Mercury_.

[[cobalt-core-install]]
Installing the _Cobalt_ core
----------------------------
Preparing the _Cobalt_ kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Xenomai/cobalt_ provides a real-time extension kernel seamlessly
integrated to Linux, therefore the first step is to build it as part
of the target kernel. To this end, `scripts/prepare-kernel.sh` is a
shell script which sets up the target kernel properly. The syntax is
as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ scripts/prepare-kernel.sh [--linux=<linux-srctree>]
[--ipipe=<ipipe-patch>] [--arch=<target-arch>]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`--linux`:: specifies the path of the target kernel source tree. Such
    kernel tree may be already configured or not, indifferently. This
    path defaults to $PWD.

`--ipipe`:: specifies the path of the interrupt pipeline (aka I-pipe)
    patch to apply against the kernel tree. Suitable patches are
    available from the project's link:/downloads/ipipe/[download
    area].  This parameter can be omitted if the I-pipe has already
    been patched in, or the script shall suggest an appropriate
    one. The script will detect whether the interrupt pipeline code is
    already present into the kernel tree, and skip this operation if
    so.

`--arch`:: tells the script about the target architecture. If
    unspecified, the build host architecture suggested as a reasonable
    default.

For instance, the following command would prepare the Linux tree
located at `/home/me/linux-3.10-ipipe` in order to patch the Xenomai
support in:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd xenomai-3
$ scripts/prepare-kernel.sh --linux=/home/me/linux-3.10
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The script will infer the location of the Xenomai kernel code
from its own location within the Xenomai source tree. For instance, if
`/home/me/xenomai-3/scripts/prepare-kernel.sh` is executing, then
the Xenomai kernel code available from
`/home/me/xenomai-3/kernel/cobalt` will be patched in the target
Linux kernel.


Configuring and compiling the _Cobalt_ kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once prepared, the target kernel can be configured as usual. All
Xenomai configuration options are available from the "Xenomai"
toplevel Kconfig menu.

There are several important kernel configuration options, documented
in the link:troubleshooting-a-dual-kernel-configuration#kconf[TROUBLESHOOTING]
guide.

Once configured, the kernel can be compiled as usual.

If you want several different configs/builds at hand, you may reuse
the same source by adding `O=../build-<target>` to each make
invocation.

In order to cross-compile the Linux kernel, pass an ARCH and
CROSS_COMPILE variable on make command line. See sections
<<cobalt-core-arm,"Building a _Cobalt/arm_ kernel">>,
<<cobalt-core-powerpc,"Building a _Cobalt/powerpc_ kernel">>,
<<cobalt-core-blackfin,"Building a _Cobalt/blackfin_ kernel">>,
<<cobalt-core-x86,"Building a _Cobalt/x86_ kernel">>,
for examples.

[[cobalt-kernel-parameters]]
_Cobalt_ kernel parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cobalt kernel accepts the following set of parameters, which
should be passed on the kernel command line by the boot loader.

[[cobalt-build-examples]]
Examples of building the _Cobalt_ kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in following sections use the following conventions:

`$linux_tree`:: path to the target kernel sources
`$xenomai_root`:: path to the Xenomai sources


[[cobalt-core-x86]]
Building a _Cobalt/x86_ kernel (32/64bit)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building _Xenomai/cobalt_ for x86 is almost the same for 32bit and 64bit
platforms. You should note, however, that it is not possible to run
Xenomai libraries compiled for x86_32 on a kernel compiled for x86_64,
and conversely.

Assuming that you want to build natively for a x86_64 system (x86_32
cross-build options from x86_64 appear between brackets), you would
typically run:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd $linux_tree
$ $xenomai_root/scripts/prepare-kernel.sh --arch=x86 \
  --ipipe=ipipe-core-X.Y.Z-x86-NN.patch
$ make [ARCH=i386] xconfig/gconfig/menuconfig
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...configure the kernel (see also the recommended settings
link:configuring-for-x86-based-dual-kernels[here]).

Enable Xenomai options, then build with:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ make [ARCH=i386] bzImage modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's say that you really want to build Xenomai for a
Pentium-based x86 32bit platform, using the native host toolchain; the
typical steps would be as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd $linux_tree
$ $xenomai_root/scripts/prepare-kernel.sh --arch=i386 \
  --ipipe=ipipe-core-X.Y.Z-x86-NN.patch
$ make xconfig/gconfig/menuconfig
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...configure the kernel (see also the recommended settings
link:configuring-for-x86-based-dual-kernels[here]).

Enable Xenomai options, then build with:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ make bzImage modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, for a 64bit platform, you would use:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd $linux_tree
$ $xenomai_root/scripts/prepare-kernel.sh --arch=x86_64 \
  --ipipe=ipipe-core-X.Y.Z-x86-NN.patch
$ make xconfig/gconfig/menuconfig
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...configure the kernel (see also the recommended settings
link:configuring-for-x86-based-dual-kernels[here]).

Enable Xenomai options, then build with:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ make bzImage modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The remaining examples illustrate how to cross-compile a
_Cobalt_-enabled kernel for various architectures. Of course, you would
have to install the proper cross-compilation toolchain for the target
system first.

[[cobalt-core-powerpc]]
Building a _Cobalt/powerpc_ kernel (32/64bit)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A typical cross-compilation setup, in order to build Xenomai for a
ppc-6xx architecture running a 3.10.32 kernel. We use the DENX ELDK
cross-compiler:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd $linux_tree
$ $xenomai_root/scripts/prepare-kernel.sh --arch=powerpc \
  --ipipe=ipipe-core-3.10.32-powerpc-1.patch
$ make ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=ppc_6xx- xconfig/gconfig/menuconfig
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...select the kernel and Xenomai options, save the configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ make ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux- uImage modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...manually install the kernel image and modules to the proper location

[[cobalt-core-blackfin]]
Building a _Cobalt/blackfin_ kernel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Blackfin is a MMU-less, DSP-type architecture running uClinux.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd $linux_tree
$ $xenomai_root/scripts/prepare-kernel.sh --arch=blackfin \
  --ipipe=ipipe-core-X.Y.Z-x86-NN.patch
$ make ARCH=blackfin CROSS_COMPILE=bfin-uclinux- xconfig/gconfig/menuconfig
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...select the kernel and Xenomai options, then compile with:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ make linux image
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...then install as needed
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cp images/linux /tftpboot/...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[cobalt-core-arm]]
Building  _Cobalt/arm_ kernel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using codesourcery toolchain named `arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc` and
compiling for a CSB637 board (AT91RM9200 based), a typical compilation
will look like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd $linux_tree
$ $xenomai_root/scripts/prepare-kernel.sh --arch=arm \
  --ipipe=ipipe-core-X.Y.Z-x86-NN.patch
$ mkdir -p $build_root/linux
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- O=$build_root/linux \
  csb637_defconfig
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- O=$build_root/linux \
  bzImage modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...manually install the kernel image, system map and modules to the proper location


[[mercury-core-install]]
Installing the _Mercury_ core
-----------------------------

For _Mercury_, you need no Xenomai-specific kernel support so far,
beyond what your host Linux kernel already provides. Your kernel
should at least provide high resolution timer support
(`CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS`), and likely complete preemption
(_PREEMPT_RT_) if your application requires short and bounded
latencies.

Kernels with no real-time support can be used too, likely for basic
debugging tasks, and/or running applications which do not have strict
response time requirements.

Therefore, unlike with _Cobalt_, there is no additional steps for
preparing and/or configuring the kernel for _Mercury_.

[[library-install]]
Installing the Xenomai libraries and tools
------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generic requirements (both cores)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- GCC must have support for legacy atomic builtins (__sync form).

- GCC should have a (sane/working) support for TLS preferably,
although this is not mandatory if building with `--disable-tls`.

- If you plan to enable the user-space registry support
  (i.e. +--enable-registry+), then CONFIG_FUSE_FS must be enabled in
  the target kernel running the real-time applications. In addition,
  the FUSE development libraries must be available from the toolchain.

- If you plan to build from the sources available from the Xenomai GIT
  tree (git.xenomai.org), the autoconf (>= 2.62), automake and libtool
  packages must be available on your build system. This is not
  required when building from a source tree extracted from a
  link:/downloads/xenomai/[release tarball].

_Cobalt_-specific requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The kernel version must be 3.10 or better.

- An interrupt pipeline (I-pipe) patch must be available for your
  target kernel. You can find the official patches issued by the
  Xenomai project link:/downloads/ipipe/[there].
  Only patches from the *ipipe-core* series are appropriate, legacy
  patches from the *adeos-ipipe* series are not.

- A timestamp counter (TSC) is required from running on a x86_32
  hardware. Unlike with Xenomai 2.x, TSC-emulation using a PIT
  register is not available.

_Mercury_-specific requirement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- There is no particular requirement for Mercury setups, although
  using a NPTL-based glibc or uClibc is recommended.

Configuring
~~~~~~~~~~~

If building the source obtained from the Xenomai GIT tree
(git.xenomai.org), the `configure` script and Makefiles must be
generated in the Xenomai source tree. The recommended way is to run
the automatic reconfiguration script shipped, from the top of the
source tree:

---------------------
$ ./scripts/bootstrap
---------------------

If building from a link:/downloads/xenomai/[release tarball], a set of
autoconf-generated file will be readily available from the extracted
source tree, and therefore reconfiguring will not be required.

When run, the generated `configure` script prepares for building the
libraries and programs, for both the _Cobalt_ and _Mercury_ cores. The
core-specific code which may be needed internally is automatically and
transparently selected at compilation-time by the build process.

The options listed below can be passed to this script.

Generic configuration options (both cores)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[horizontal]
*--with=core=<type>*::

	Indicates which real-time core you want to build the support
	libraries for, namely _cobalt_ or _mercury_. This option
	defaults to _cobalt_.

*--prefix=<dir>*:: 

	Specifies the root installation path for libraries, include
	files, scripts and executables. Running `$ make install`
	installs these files to `$DESTDIR/<dir>`.  This directory
	defaults to /usr/xenomai.

*--enable-debug[=partial]*::

	This switch controls the debug level. Three levels are
	available, with varying overhead:

	- _symbols_ enables debug symbols to be compiled in the
	libraries and executables, still turning on the optimizer
	(-O2). This option has no overhead, it is useful to get
	meaningful backtraces using gdb while running the application
	at nominal speed.

	- _partial_ includes _symbols_, and also turns on internal
	consistency checks within the Xenomai code (mostly present in
	the Copperplate layer). The `CONFIG_XENO_DEBUG` macro is
	defined, for both the Xenomai libraries and the applications
	getting their C compilation flags from the `xeno-config`
	script (i.e. `xeno-config --cflags`). The partial debug mode
	implicitly turns on `--enable-assert`. A measurable overhead
	is introduced by this level.  This is the default level when
	`--enable-debug` is mentioned with no level specification.

	- _full_ includes _partial_ settings, but the optimizer is
	disabled (-O0), and even more consistency checks may be
	performed.  In addition to `__XENO_DEBUG__`, the macro
	`CONFIG_XENO_DEBUG_FULL` is defined. This level introduces the
	most overhead, which may triple the worst-case latency, or
	even more.

[normal]
	Over the _Mercury_ core, enabling _partial_ or _full_ debug
	modes also causes the standard malloc interface to be used
	internally instead of a fast real-time allocator (TLSF). This
	allows debugging memory-related issues with the help of
	_Valgrind_ or other dynamic memory analysers.

*--disable-debug*::

	 Fully turns off all consistency checks and assertions, turns
         on the optimizer and disables debug symbol generation.

*--enable-assert*::

	A number of debug assertion statements are present into the
	Xenomai libraries, checking the internal consistency of the
	runtime system dynamically (see _man assert(3)_). Passing
	`--disable-assert` to the _configure_ script disables built-in
	assertions unconditionally. By default, assertions are enabled
	in partial or full debug modes, disabled otherwise.

*--enable-pshared*::

	Enable shared multi-processing. When enabled, this option
	allows multiple processes to share real-time objects
	(e.g. tasks, semaphores).

*--enable-registry[=/registry-root-path]*::

	Xenomai APIs can export their internal state through a
	pseudo-filesystem, which files may be read to obtain
	information about the existing real-time objects, such as
	tasks, semaphores, message queues and so on.  This feature is
	supported by http://fuse.sourceforge.net/[FUSE], which must be
	available on the target system. Building the Xenomai libraries
	with the registry support requires the FUSE development
	libraries to available from the toolchain. In addition,
	CONFIG_FUSE_FS must be enabled in the target kernel.

[normal]
When this option is enabled, the system creates a file hierachy at
`<user>/<session>/<pid>` under the registry root path, where you
can access the internal state of the active real-time objects. The
session label is obtained from the --session runtime switch. If no
session name is specified, `anon@<pid>` will be used. E.g. looking at
the properties of a VxWorks task could be done as follows:

If not specified in the configuration switch, the registry root path
will be +/var/run/xenomai+.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cat /var/run/xenomai/root/anon@12656/12656/vxworks/tasks/windTask 
name       = windTask
errno      = 0
status     = ready
priority   = 70
lock_depth = 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------

[normal]
	You may override the default root of the registry hierarchy
	either statically at build time by passing the desired root
	path to the --enable-registry configuration switch, or
	dynamically by using the `--registry-root` runtime option
	passed to the application.

[NOTE]
When running over _Xenomai/cobalt_, the `/proc/xenomai` interface is
also available for inspecting the core system state.

*--enable-lores-clock*::

	Enables support for low resolution clocks. By default,
	libraries are built with no support for tick-based timing. If
	you need such support (e.g. for pSOS (TM) or VxWorks (TM)
	APIs), then you can turn it on using this option.

[NOTE]
The POSIX API does not support tick-based timing. Alchemy may use it
optionally.

*--enable-clock-monotonic-raw*::

	The Xenomai libraries requires a monotonic clock to be
	available from the underlying POSIX interface. When
	`CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` is available on your system, you may
	want to pass this switch, otherwise `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` will be
	used by default.

[NOTE]
The _Cobalt_ core implements `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`, so this switch is
turned on by default when building with `--with-core=cobalt`. On the
contrary, this option is turned off by default when building for the
_Mercury_ core, since we don't know in advance whether this feature
does exist on the target kernel.

*--enable-tls*::

	Xenomai can use GCC's thread local storage extension (TLS) to
	speed up the retrieval of the per-thread information it uses
	internally. This switch enables TLS, use the converse
	`--disable-tls` to prevent this.

[normal]
	Due to GCC bugs regarding this feature with some
	release,architecture combinations, whether TLS is turned on by
	default is a per-architecture decision. Currently, this
	feature is enabled for x86 and powerpc by default, other
	architectures will require `--enable-tls` to be passed to the
	_configure_ script explicitly.

[normal]
	Unless `--enable-dlopen-libs` is present, the _initial-exec_
	TLS model is selected.

[normal]
	When TLS is disabled, POSIX's thread-specific data management
	services are used internally (i.e. pthread_set/getspecific()).

*--enable-dlopen-libs*::

	This switch allows programs to load Xenomai-based libraries
	dynamically, using the `dlopen(3)` routine. Enabling dynamic
	loading introduces some overhead in TLS accesses when enabled
	(see `--enable-tls`), which might be noticeable depending on
	the architecture.

[normal]
	To support dynamic loading when `--enable-tls` is turned on,
	the _global-dynamic_ TLS model is automatically selected.

[normal]
	Dynamic loading of Xenomai-based libraries is disabled by
	default.

*--enable-async-cancel*::

	Enables fully asynchronous cancellation of Xenomai threads
	created by the real-time APIs, making provision to protect the
	Xenomai implementation code accordingly.
[normal]
	When disabled, Xenomai assumes that threads may exit due to
	cancellation requests only when they reach cancellation points
	(like system calls). Asynchronous cancellation is disabled
	by default.

[CAUTION]
Fully asynchronous cancellation can easily lead to resource leakage,
silent corruption, safety issues and all sorts of rampant bugs. The
only reason to turn this feature on would be aimed at cancelling
threads which run significantly long, syscall-less busy loops with no
explicit exit condition, which should probably be revisited anyway.

*--enable-smp*::

	Turns on SMP support for Xenomai libraries.

[CAUTION]
SMP support must be enabled in Xenomai libraries when the
client applications are running over a SMP-capable kernel.

*--disable-sanity*::

	Turns off the sanity checks performed at application startup
	by the Xenomai libraries. This option sets a default, which
	can later be overriden using the --[no-]sanity options passed
	to a Copperplate-based Xenomai application. Sanity checks are
	enabled by default when configuring.

*--enable-fortify*::

	Enables `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` when building the Xenomai code
	unless --enable-debug=full is also given on the command line,
	in which case --enable-fortify is silently ignored.

*--disable-valgrind-client*::

	Turns off the Valgrind client support, forcing
	`CONFIG_XENO_VALGRIND_API` off in the Xenomai configuration
	header.

*--enable-doc-build*::

	Causes the inline Xenomai documentation based on the
	http://doxygen.org[Doxygen markup language] to be produced as
	PDF and HTML documents. Additional documentation like manpages
	based on the http://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc markup language] is
	produced too.

footnoteref:[disable,Each option enabled by default can be forcibly

Cross-compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to cross-compile the Xenomai libraries and programs, you will
need to pass a `--host` and `--build` option to the _configure_
script. The `--host` option allow to select the architecture for which
the libraries and programs are built. The `--build` option allows to
choose the architecture on which the compilation tools are run,
i.e. the system running the _configure_ script.

Since cross-compiling requires specific tools, such tools are
generally prefixed with the host architecture name; for example, a
compiler for the PowerPC architecture may be named
`powerpc-linux-gcc`.

When passing `--host=powerpc-linux` to configure, it will
automatically use `powerpc-linux-` as a prefix to all
compilation tools names and infer the host architecture name from this
prefix. If configure is unable to infer the architecture name from the
cross-compilation tools prefix, you will have to manually pass the
name of all compilation tools using at least the CC and LD, variables
on configure command line.

The easiest way to build a GNU cross-compiler might involve using
crosstool-ng, available http://crosstool-ng.org/[here].

If you want to avoid to build your own cross compiler, you might if
find easier to use the ELDK. It includes the GNU cross development
tools, such as the compilers, binutils, gdb, etc., and a number of
pre-built target tools and libraries required on the target
system. See http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/ELDK[here] for further
details.

Some other pre-built toolchains:

- Mentor Sourcery CodeBench Lite Edition, available
http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/[here];
- Linaro toolchain (for the ARM architecture), available
https://launchpad.net/linaro-toolchain-binaries[here].


[[library-install-examples]]
Examples of building the Xenomai libraries and tools
----------------------------------------------------

The examples in following sections use the following conventions:

`$xenomai_root`:: path to the Xenomai sources
`$build_root`:: path to a clean build directory
`$staging_dir`:: path to a directory that will hold the installed file
 temporarily before they are moved to their final location; when used
 in a cross-compilation setup, it is usually a NFS mount point from
 the target's root directory to the local build host, as a
 consequence of which running `make{nbsp}DESTDIR=$staging_dir{nbsp}install` on
 the host immediately updates the target system with the installed
 programs and libraries.

CAUTION: In the examples below, make sure to add `--enable-smp` to the
_configure_ script options if building for a SMP-enabled kernel.

Building the x86 libraries (32/64bit)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming that you want to build the _Mercury_ libraries natively for a
x86_64/SMP system, enabling shared multi-processing support. You would
typically run:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mkdir $build_root && cd $build_root
$ $xenomai_root/configure --with-core=mercury --enable-smp --enable-pshared
$ make install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conversely, cross-building the _Cobalt_ libraries from x86_64 with the
same feature set, for running on x86_32 could be:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mkdir $build_root && cd $build_root
$ $xenomai_root/configure --with-core=cobalt --enable-smp --enable-pshared \
  --host=i686-linux CFLAGS="-m32 -O2" LDFLAGS="-m32"
$ make install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing the build tree (i.e. using "make install"), the
installation root should be populated with the librairies, programs
and header files you can use to build Xenomai-based real-time
applications.  This directory path defaults to `/usr/xenomai`.

The remaining examples illustrate how to cross-compile Xenomai for
various architectures. Of course, you would have to install the proper
cross-compilation toolchain for the target system first.

Building the PPC32 libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A typical cross-compilation setup, in order to build the _Cobalt_
libraries for a ppc-6xx architecture. In that example, we want the
debug symbols to be generated for the executable, with no runtime
overhead though. We use the DENX ELDK cross-compiler:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd $build_root
$ $xenomai_root/configure --host=powerpc-linux --with-core=cobalt \
  --enable-debug=symbols
$ make DESTDIR=$staging_dir install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building the PPC64 libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same process than for a 32bit PowerPC target, using a crosstool-built
toolchain for ppc64/SMP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd $build_root
$ $xenomai_root/configure --host=powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu \
  --with-core=cobalt --enable-smp
$ make DESTDIR=$staging_dir install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Building the Blackfin libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another cross-compilation setup, in order to build the _Cobalt_
libraries for the Blackfin architecture. We use
http://blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=toolchain:installing[ADI's
toolchain] for this purpose:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mkdir $build_root && cd $build_root
$ $xenomai_root/configure --host=bfin-linux-uclibc --with-core=cobalt
$ make DESTDIR=$staging_dir install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
Xenomai uses the FDPIC shared library format on this architecture. In
case of problem running the testsuite, try restarting the last two
build steps, passing the `--disable-shared` option to the "configure"
script.


Building the ARM libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using codesourcery toolchain named `arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc` and
compiling for a CSB637 board (AT91RM9200 based), a typical cross-compilation
from a x86_32 desktop would look like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mkdir $build_root/xenomai && cd $build_root/xenomai
$ $xenomai_root/configure CFLAGS="-march=armv4t" LDFLAGS="-march=armv4t" \
  --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- --with-core=cobalt
$ make DESTDIR=$staging_dir install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Unlike previous releases, Xenomai no longer passes any arm
architecture specific flags, or FPU flags to gcc, so, users are
expected to pass them using the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables as
demonstrated above, where the AT91RM9200 is based on the ARM920T core,
implementing the `armv4` architecture. The following table summarizes
the CFLAGS and options which were automatically passed in previous
revisions and which now need to be explicitely passed to configure,
for the supported SOCs:

|sa1100      | `-march=armv4t -msoft-float`        | --enable-arm-quirks=sa1100
|======================================================================

It is possible to build for an older architecture version (v6 instead
of v7, or v4 instead of v5), if your toolchain does not support the
target architecture, the only restriction being that if SMP is
enabled, the architecture should not be less than v6.


Testing the installation
------------------------

Booting the _Cobalt_ kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to test the Xenomai installation over _Cobalt_, you should
first try to boot the patched kernel. Check the kernel boot log for
messages like these:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ dmesg | grep -i xenomai
I-pipe: head domain Xenomai registered.
[Xenomai] Cobalt vX.Y.Z enabled
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If the kernel fails booting, or the log messages indicates an error
status instead, see the
link:troubleshooting-a-dual-kernel-configuration#Kernel_log_displays_Xenomai_or_I-pipe_error_messages[TROUBLESHOOTING]
guide.


Testing the real-time system (both cores)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, run the latency test:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ /usr/xenomai/bin/latency
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The latency test should display a message every second with minimum,
maximum and average latency values. If this test displays an error
message, hangs, or displays unexpected values, see the
link:troubleshooting-a-dual-kernel-configuration#the_latency_test_shows_high_latencies[TROUBLESHOOTING]
guide.

If the latency test succeeds, you should try next to run the
`xeno-test` test in order to assess the worst-case latency of your
system. Try:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ xeno-test --help
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calibrating the _Cobalt_ core timer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The accuracy of the Cobalt timing services depends on proper
calibration of its core timer. Sound factory-default calibration
values are defined for each platform Xenomai supports, but it is
recommended to calibrate the core timer specifically for the target
system.

See the documentation about the
link:../documentation/xenomai-3/html/man1/autotune/index.html[autotune(1)]
utility.

Building and running Xenomai 3 applications
-------------------------------------------

Once the latency test behaves as expected on your target system, it is
deemed ready to run real-time applications.

You may want to have a look at
link:building-applications-with-xenomai-3.x/[this
document] for details about the application build process.

In addition, you may refer to
link:running-applications-with-xenomai-3.x/[this document] to learn
about the command line options available with Xenomai 3 applications.

Migrating applications to Xenomai 3
-----------------------------------

If you plan to port an existing application based on Xenomai 2.x to
Xenomai 3.x, you should have a look at
link:migrating-from-xenomai-2.x-to-3.x/[this migration guide].
