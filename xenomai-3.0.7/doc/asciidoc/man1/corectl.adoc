NAME
----
corectl - Cobalt core control interface

SYNOPSIS
---------
*corectl* [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
------------
*corectl* is a utility to 

OPTIONS
--------
*corectl* accepts the following options:

*--stop [<grace-seconds>]*:: Stop the real-time services. The
following actions are taken in sequence:

- termination of all Xenomai threads running in user-space, waiting
for them to exit for at most +grace-seconds+ if specified, or
indefinitely otherwise.

- active RTDM drivers are notified of the transition to the stopped
state.

- termination of lingering RTDM threads (i.e. running in kernel
space), waiting for them to exit for at most 3 seconds.

- deactivation of the real-time timing services, control of the
hardware timer on all real-time CPUs is fully released to the host
kernel.

Once stopped, the Cobalt core rejects all connection requests from
regular applications.

*--start*:: Start the real-time services. The following actions are
taken in sequence:

- activation of the real-time timing services, the Cobalt core takes
full control over the hardware timer on all real-time CPUs.

- loaded RTDM drivers are notified of the transition to the running
state.

Once started, the Cobalt core accepts all connection requests from
regular applications anew.

*--status*:: Display the current Cobalt core status. The following
statuses can be returned:

- _disabled_ denotes a fully inoperative core. This state cannot be
reached using the *corectl* command, but only by passing the
+xenomai.state=disabled+ option on the kernel command line. A disabled
core cannot be started dynamically using *corectl*.

- _stopped_ means that no further connection request will be accepted
from applications, the real-time services are currently
unavailable. The Cobalt core can be stopped at boot time by passing
the +xenomai.state=stopped+ option on the kernel command line. A
stopped core can be started dynamically using *corectl --start*,
switching it to the _running_ state.

- _running_ denotes an active state of the real-time core, application
requests are processed normally. This is the default state entered at
boot time, which corresponds to passing the +xenomai.state=enabled+
option on the kernel command line.

- _teardown_ denotes a real-time system in the process of stopping all
services. This transient status should not be seen unless some threads
are unexpectedly lingering despite a termination request was issued.

- _warmup_ denotes a real-time system in the process of starting all
services. This transient status should not be seen unless an RTDM
driver gets stuck while switching to active mode.

*--help*::
Display a short help.

If no option is passed, +--status+ is assumed by default.

VERSIONS
--------
*corectl* appeared in Xenomai 3.0 for the _Cobalt_ real-time core.
