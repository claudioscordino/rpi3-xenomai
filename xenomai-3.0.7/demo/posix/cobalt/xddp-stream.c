 * XDDP-based RT/NRT threads communication demo.
 *
 * Real-time Xenomai threads and regular Linux threads may want to
 * exchange data in a way that does not require the former to leave
 * the real-time domain (i.e. secondary mode). Message pipes - as
 * implemented by the RTDM-based XDDP protocol - are provided for this
 * purpose.
 *
 * On the Linux domain side, pseudo-device files named /dev/rtp<minor>
 * give regular POSIX threads access to non real-time communication
 * endpoints, via the standard character-based I/O interface. On the
 * Xenomai domain side, sockets may be bound to XDDP ports, which act
 * as proxies to send and receive data to/from the associated
 * pseudo-device files. Ports and pseudo-device minor numbers are
 * paired, meaning that e.g. port 7 will proxy the traffic for
 * /dev/rtp7. Therefore, port numbers may range from 0 to
 * CONFIG_XENO_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV - 1.
 *
 * All data sent through a bound/connected XDDP socket via sendto(2) or
 * write(2) will be passed to the peer endpoint in the Linux domain,
 * and made available for reading via the standard read(2) system
 * call. Conversely, all data sent using write(2) through the non
 * real-time endpoint will be conveyed to the real-time socket
 * endpoint, and made available to the recvfrom(2) or read(2) system
 * calls.
 *
 * In addition to sending datagrams, real-time threads may stream data
 * in a byte-oriented mode through the proxy as well. This increases
 * the bandwidth and reduces the overhead, when a lot of data has to
 * flow down to the Linux domain, if keeping the message boundaries is
 * not required. The example code below illustrates such use.
