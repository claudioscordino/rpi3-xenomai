 * POSIXish condition variable mechanism
 *
 * A condition variable is a synchronization mechanism which allows
 * tasks to suspend execution until some predicate on some arbitrary
 * shared data is satisfied.
 *
 * The basic operations on conditions are: signal the condition (when
 * the predicate becomes true), and wait for the condition, blocking
 * the task execution until another task signals the condition.  A
 * condition variable must always be associated with a mutex, to avoid
 * a well-known race condition where a task prepares to wait on a
 * condition variable and another task signals the condition just
 * before the first task actually waits on it.

 * @param cond The address of a condition variable descriptor which
